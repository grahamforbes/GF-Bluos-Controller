# GF-Bluos-Controller

This is a simple bluos controller app to make life easier.
The idea was to get a simple way to set up and access playlists, but loading the full song collection using fetch did not seem to work (any suggestions anyone) but at least it is easy to polay presets and playlists from one interface.

I don't think the Bluos API documentation is entirely clear so I may have missed something obvious.

Feel free to improve upon this and let me know if you do.
